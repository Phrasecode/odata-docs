# Getting Started

This guide will help you get up and running with the Node OData Framework quickly.

## Overview

The Node OData Framework provides **two powerful integration approaches** to suit different application architectures:

### 1. **ExpressRouter** - Complete Express.js Solution

A fully-managed solution for OData application. The framework automatically:

- Registers all OData endpoints based on your controllers
- Sets up the `$metadata` endpoint for API discovery
- Handles request parsing and response formatting
- Manages error handling and logging

**Best for:** When you want minimal setup and easy integration with the complete solution

👉 **[Complete Express.js Guide](./express-getting-started.md)**

### 2. **OpenRouter** - Framework-Agnostic Solution

A flexible, low-level solution that integrates with any Node.js framework or serverless environment. You have full control over:

- Route registration and endpoint paths
- Request/response handling
- Middleware integration
- Custom authentication and authorization

**Best for:** When you need maximum flexibility and control over the application
